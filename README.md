Project Title: NAVIGATE THE MARS ROVER 
Problem statement: To calculate the shortest path between the source and the destination through a stopping point.
Consider a source node ‘S’, a stopping point ‘SP’ and a final destination node ‘D’. The sum of the length of the shortest path from ‘S’ to ‘SP’ and from ‘SP’ to’ D’ would be returned as shown in the following block diagram.

FIG: SHORTEST PATH FROM SOURCE (S) TO FINAL DESTINATION (D) THROUGH THE STOPPING POINT (SP)

Grid Made:
We have made a grid in which we'll be having three points in the starting first as the starting point, second as the stopping point and the third as the destination. 
By using a mouse command, the obstacles will be built on the grid. These obstacles are of grey colour.
Once the search starts it recognises the grey boxes in the grid as not walkable and creates a shortest path considering the obstacles.

Algorithm to be used: A* Search Algorithm
A*Search algorithm, unlike other algorithms, is a smart algorithm which is used by many games and web-based graphs to find the shortest path. A*Search algorithm is a graph traversal and a path search algorithm.
